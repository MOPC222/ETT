#ETT
Engineering Tech Tree

This fork is based on the ETT update 25052025 fetched from CKAN/Spacedock. The repo was forked off outdated 2016 repository in case ProbusThrax decides to update it in the future.


Sizeable edits were made to the tree, all nodes are now aligned to the grid more strictly.
New connections in Airframes branch, complex mechanical systems now require Bearings (old Nanolathing).
New connections in CommandModules branch, requiring more cross-research for high-end parts.
New Ablators-Reentry branch - intended to separate heat shields from Sterling Systems extensive heat management parts list. Probably less useful without the mod, might make a patch to enable it conditionally.


Mod support was added/reworked for:
Kerbalism (only tested with KerbalismSimplex)
OpenCockpit
AirplanePlus
Taerobee
MoreServos
Interkosmos
Inflatable PicoPort
InternalRCS (partial, the mod is quite bloated so I only use like 3 parts from it)
SterlingSystems (partial, updated parts list at the time of the commit)
Supplementary Electric Engines
Engine Ignitor (WIP)
ResearchBodies
TarsierSpaceTech
RealBattery
KerBalloons
