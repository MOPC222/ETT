# Engineering Tech Tree

### This fork is based on the ETT update 25052025 fetched from CKAN/Spacedock. The repo was forked off outdated 2016 repository in case ProbusThrax decides to update it in the future.

- Sizeable edits were made to the tree, all nodes are now aligned to the grid more strictly.
- New connections in Airframes branch, complex mechanical systems now require Bearings (old Nanolathing).
- New connections in CommandModules branch, requiring more cross-research for high-end parts.
- New Ablators-Reentry branch - intended to separate heat shields from Sterling Systems extensive heat management parts list. Probably less useful without the mod, might make a patch to enable it conditionally.

Mod support was added/reworked for:
Kerbalism (only tested with KerbalismSimplex)
OpenCockpit
AirplanePlus
Taerobee
MoreServos
Interkosmos
Inflatable PicoPort
InternalRCS (partial, the mod is quite bloated so I only use like 3 parts from it)
SterlingSystems (partial, updated parts list at the time of the commit)
Supplementary Electric Engines
Engine Ignitor (WIP)
ResearchBodies
More Airplane Parts

### Mod support added:  
- Kerbalism (only tested with KerbalismSimplex)  
- RealBattery (upgrades correctly assigned to Electrics branch)  
- Engine Ignitor (upgrades assigned to correct places for stock parts, mods support WIP)  
- Taerobee  
- OpenCockpit  
- MoreServos  
- Interkosmos  
- Inflatable PicoPort  
- Supplementary Electric Engines  
- InternalRCS (partial, the mod is quite bloated so I only use like 3 parts from it)  
- TarsierSpaceTech  
- ResearchBodies  
- KerBalloons  
- More Airplane Parts  
### Mod support rebalanced/updated:  
- AirplanePlus   
- SterlingSystems (partially, mainly heat management. Parts list at the time of the commit)
