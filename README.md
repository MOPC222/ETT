# ETT
Engineering Tech Tree

This fork is based on the ETT update 25052025 on CKAN, but was forked off outdated 2016 repository in case ProbusThrax decides to update it.

Some quite sizeable edits were made to the tree, many node names were changed and parts rebalanced, especially aviation and early rocketry.

Mod support has been added for: 
Taerobee
Interkosmos
Inflatable PicoPort
MoreServos
InternalRCS (partial, the mod is quite bloated so I only use like 2 parts from it)
Engine Ignitor (WIP, doesn't change part upgrades yet)
