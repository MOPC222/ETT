//
// This is a debugging file that collects all parts not yet assigned to tech nodes by ETT to the Island of Misfit Toys node in the middle,
// allowing me to quickly identify parts that could benefit from a balancing patch.
//
// It's better to disable/delete this config if you're not actively editing ETT so that parts stay in places assigned by their author.
// That might result in messy progression, but at least your parts won't become completely inaccessible

Alternatively, delete misfitToys.cfg in GameData/ETT folder and install Hide Empty Tech Tree Nodes mod or re-check its configuration. This also holds parts that are conditionally soft-disabled based on your installed DLCs and mod list.
