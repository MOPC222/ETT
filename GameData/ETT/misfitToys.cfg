		description = If you see this node, that means there are mods installed that are not natively supported by ETT. Please open an issue on Github for a patch to be made. Alternatively, delete misfitToys.cfg in GameData/ETT folder and install Hide Empty Tech Tree Nodes mod or re-check its configuration. This also holds parts that are conditionally soft-disabled based on your installed DLCs and mod list.
