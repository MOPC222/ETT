Version 20250530 Update Log:
- General update.
- CLEAN INSTALL REQUIRED.  Failure to do so may cause techtrees to overwrite each other causing a techtree that is a jumbled mess.
- Added:
-->  @TechTree:FINAL
-->  {
-->    	-RDNode,* {}
-->  // Added to clear non-ETT Techtrees.
to the top of the engtechtreenew.cfg configuration file to help in compatibility with other tech trees.  Clears all nodes so that the ETT can overwrite them smoothly.
- Split engines and fuel tanks into seperate branches.
- Engines added to the tree depending on:
	isp and thrust
	sustainers, multifunction, or boosters
	liquid or crygenic engines
- Aviation branch reevaluated and updated.
- Air breathing engines distributed more efficiently.
- Nuclear engines redistributed.
- Tree branches moved to make the tree a little more easier to read.
- Added many new icons including KSPIE and CTT icons (used with permission).
- Added descriptions to new tech tree nodes.
- Releveled node costs.
- Test of tech node as a title (Jet Engines).



Thanks to Freethinker and Nertea for their permission to use their tech tree icons.  It was a big help!
